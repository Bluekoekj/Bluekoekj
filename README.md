### Oh hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Bluekoekj, and youv'e landed at my GitHub profile! Here is what I do

## My website

I have a website being hosted on GitHub, located at https://bluekoekj.github.io and it regularly gets updates, so don't worry about a missing feature or something

## Photography

I like taking lots of photos, and have recently bought a camcorder to take more photos. I wont show you them here, but you can go to https://bluekoekj.github.io/photograpy if you want that.

**Please be aware that this readme is not complete and more stuff will be added soon**
